# leela-zero-scala
An experiment to see how hard it would be to port [leela-zero](https://github.com/gcp/leela-zero) to [Scala](http://www.scala-js.org/).

The project that I am attempting to port from is [https://github.com/gcp/leela-zero,](https://github.com/gcp/leela-zero) created by Gian-Carlo Pascutto.
